	<h1> About me:</h1>
	<p> Hi! My name is E<b>liz</b>abeth Johnson, but I go by Liz. I have a degree in Photography and another degree in Wildlife Sciences. <br>I grew up in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5DXLJgotrY">Oklahoma</a>, ah not that Oklahoma!, this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma"> Oklahoma</a>. </p>

		<h3>These days...</h3>
		I just moved to Portland about a month ago and I'm enjoying life here so far. I have lived in the Pacific Northwest for several years now and I currently work as a LiDAR editing technician. <br>In my spare time I enjoy hiking, biking, and pretty much anything that involves being outside. Right now I'm taking a Code Fellows Foundations class and am looking forward to learning some skills in web development to enhance my resume.</p><p>I am also very much looking forward to turning this BASIC web page into something a bit more engaging! I'm guessing code fellows can help...</p>
